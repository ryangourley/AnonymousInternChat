# Anonymous Internship Chat Client

This is a simple application written for node/express with socket.io that can support up to 80 people in the chatroom (after 80 people we run out of unique aliases and a while loop runs infinitely...)

To run:
```sh
npm install
node index.js
```

##Note
This only works if you have computers all connected on the same LAN and thus have access to your localhost port 3000.  This is what I have at work.

Have fun!
